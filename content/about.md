One man. One dream. Lots of cupcakes.

Crow's King Cakery is the fever dream of a man who decided in late 2023 that he didn't have enough to do in the day.  With a full time job and a handful of major commitments already on-going, this man decided to transform his cupcake baking hobby into a full-blown hustle. Little did he know that his friends and family would support him fully, meaning he had to see this thing through to the end.

Thanks to the incredible folks in his life, Crow King's Cakery's owner and sole employee has spent several months catering birthdays, weddings, and literary festivals - and couldn't be happier. With a taste for the weird, the unusual, and the delicious, his creations have brought smiles to tens of people - with the hope to soon reach tens more.
