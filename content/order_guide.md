# Crow’s King Cakery Order Guide

Please submit your order up to a week ahead of time.

At this time, I will be using a “slots” system for orders. When orders are being taken, there will be a certain number of “slots” available for orders, which will be filled on a first-come-first-served basis.

Each order must be for *one flavor* per ½ dozen. If I ever open a real storefront, I will happily fulfill mixed orders! (Custom orders have wiggle room on this, though - [contact me](mailto:crowskingcakery@gmail.com) for more details.)

With your order, please include amount of cupcakes (minimum ½ dozen), cake base flavor, frosting type and flavor, plus any extras such as filling, toppings, etc. Please also include a name, e-mail, and phone number for contact. Finally, include the date and time you would like the order completed! 

Or, if you’d like, click [here](https://forms.gle/WjgAkxqxNVVnnx3i8) for my Google Forms ordering form!

If not using the Google Form, please e-mail your order to [crowskingcakery@gmail.com](mailto:crowskingcakery@gmail.com)

**For custom orders\***, Vegan and Diabetic-Friendly options, or other questions/concerns, please [e-mail me](mailto:crowskingcakery@gmail.com) directly (or use the Google Form)!

I will confirm your order, including cost, via e-mail after it has been received. 

I require ½ of full cost upfront, the second ½ to be paid in full upon delivery and/or pick-up.

I offer free delivery within 10 miles of [Campbell, OH](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Campbell,+OH/@41.0764609,-80.6291194,13z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8833ee4ab02e45fb:0x730ed5e49d60ce40!8m2!3d41.0783918!4d-80.5992396!16zL20vMHlfNjg?entry=ttu). If you’d like your order delivered further, be aware that there may be a fee.

 In the event that I have received more orders than open slots (as I am but one person with limited capacity), you will receive an e-mail explaining that your order may not be fulfilled at that time.

All cupcakes are the “regular”, standard cupcake size. (I hope to have other sizes available soon!)

**\*More on Custom Orders:** Custom orders are my pride and joy! If you’ve ever had one of my cupcakes, you’ve had a “custom” creation. For some examples of custom flavors, scroll to the bottom of this document. Pricing on custom orders varies greatly depending on complexity of the order and materials used.

## CUSTOM ORDERS & EXAMPLES

The options are endless! If you have an idea for a custom order or would like me to work with you to formulate a specialty cupcake to your tastes, please let me know!

## A Note and Disclaimer Regarding Common Allergens, Including Gluten

I *do not* have access to separate equipment that would allow me to ensure complete lack of cross contamination of allergens, including gluten, at this time - therefore, I cannot in good faith claim to be able to provide allergen safe or even allergen friendly baked goods. I’ve seen the term “Gluten and/or Allergen Conscious” to disclaim products made without gluten/allergens in an otherwise contaminated kitchen, but I would prefer to be clearer than that! So, if you have *any* food allergens, please reconsider placing an order with me. I would prefer your health over your business!
